Numerical simulation of heat transer for a house coated with higly reflective paint vs ordinary paint. The simulation uses method of finite diferences to calculate heat transfered through the walls of the building. Temperature on the outside walls are being tracked as well as heat current necesary to keep indoor temperature of house constant.

Program was written in python together with a collage from university for aproject at Heat transfer class.
