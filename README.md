# Prenos-toplote

Numerical simulation of heat transfer for a house coated with highly reflective paint vs ordinary paint. The simulation uses method of finite differences to calculate heat transferred through the walls of the building. Temperature on the outside walls are being tracked as well as heat current necessary to keep indoor temperature of house constant.

Program was written in python together with a collage from university for a project at Heat transfer class. It can be run by running the Gui2.py file (pygame library is necessary). To run the program or stop it press right arrow on keyboard
